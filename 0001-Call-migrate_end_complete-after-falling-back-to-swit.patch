Subject: [PATCH 1/8] Call migrate_end_complete() after falling back to
 switch-host
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Eventually, during a seamless migration, qemu may finish to migrate
before the spice client even finished to connect all channels to
destination and informed the server. In this case,
main_channel_client_migrate_src_complete() will fall back to
switch-host method, and reds_mig_fill_wait_disconnect() is called to
complete the migration (disconnecting all channels).

reds_mig_cleanup() is called when all channels are disconnected, but
reds->mig_wait_connect is still TRUE, and it will call
migrate_connect_complete() instead of the expected
migrate_end_complete(). Setting reds->mig_wait_connect to FALSE when
reds_mig_fill_wait_disconnect() solves the issue.
